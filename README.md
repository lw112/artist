# Laura Weihl

## Artist Statement

In my artistic practice, I engage with the canvas as a space of
meditative exploration, where each painting is a dialogue between 
color and texture. The titles of my works, inspired by the music
that flows around me as I paint, are like companions that 
subtly influence the mood and direction of my art.
